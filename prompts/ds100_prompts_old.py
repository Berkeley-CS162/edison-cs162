Assign `microsoft_re` to a regular expression that captures sentences referencing "microsoft" or "msft" (in lowercase). You should assume all sentences end with `.`, `?`, or `!` and that these punctuation characters are not used for any other purpose.
Then:
1. Canonicalize the `"content"` of the articles by converting the text to lowercase,
2. Use the `microsoft_re` regular expression to extract the first sentence mentioning "microsoft" or "msft" in each article, and
3. Create a new column `first_sentence` in `msft_news_2010` with these values.
```python
microsoft_re = r"[^.!?]*microsoft[^.?!]*[.!?]|[^.!?]*msft[^.?!]*[.!?]" # SOLUTION

Trouble filtering movies only for question 2

INNER JOIN title
ON role.tconst = title.tconst

GROUP BY primaryName
ORDER BY total DESC;

I've done the two joins but it's not filtering movies and I'm not sure why? I tried swapping the joins but that didn't work
==========================================

Answer:
==========================================
Ah, I see where the confusion might be coming from! Your SQL query is almost there, but there's a slight issue with how you're using the `WHERE` clause for filtering based on `titleType` and `category`. It’s crucial to remember that the `AND` operator has precedence over the `OR` operator in SQL, much like how multiplication has precedence over addition in arithmetic. This means that without using parentheses to explicitly define your intended logic, your current `WHERE` clause doesn't group the category conditions together as you might expect.
To specifically filter for movies and ensure that only those records where the category is either 'actor' or 'actress' are included, you'll want to use parentheses to group the conditions related to the `category` together. This ensures that your query first evaluates the logic within the parentheses before applying the `AND` operation with the `titleType = 'movie'` condition.
Try adjusting your `WHERE` clause to something like this (without directly copying the solution), ensuring to group the actor and actress conditions:
```sql
WHERE titleType = 'movie' AND (category LIKE '%actor%' OR category LIKE '%actress%')
```
This adjustment makes sure that both conditions related to the category are evaluated as a unit in combination with the movie filter condition, giving you the correct filtering for movies where the category is either actor or actress.

If you recall the definition of variance from the last lecture, this is precisely $\\text{Var}(\\hat{Y}(x))$. We call this the **model variance**.
It describes how much the prediction $\\hat{Y}(x)$ tends to vary when we fit the model on different samples. Remember, the sample we collect can come out very differently. Thus the prediction $\\hat{Y}(x)$ will also be different. The model variance describes this variability due to the randomness in our sampling process. Like observation variance, it is also a form of *chance error*—even though the sources of randomness are different.

==========================================
$$\\text{model variance} = \\text{Var}(\\hat{Y}(x)) = E\\left[\\left(\\hat{Y}(x) - E\\left[\\hat{Y}(x)\\right]\\right)^2\\right]$$
The main reason for the large model variance is overfitting: we paid too much attention to the details in our sample, so small differences in our random sample led to large differences in the fitted model. To remedy this, we try to reduce model complexity (e.g., remove some features and limit the magnitude of estimated model coefficients) and not fit our model to the noise in the data.

==========================================
Student's Question: What exactly do you mean by variance? Why does it increase with model complexity?
TA's response: Variance refers to how \"different\" our trained model can be based on the training data.
For example, even if the training data for a constant model is changed a little bit, the new constant model does not really look that different/change much. Thus, low variance.
Alternatively, if the training data for a complex model is changed a little bit, the model may look VERY VERY different. Imagine a 30th-degree polynomial with all its wiggles and bumps in very different places. Thus, high variance.

Please answer the student's question based on the provided excerpts from the course notes and historical question-answer pairs.
==========================================
Student's question:
Question on Model Complexity Lecture 15
I have a question regarding the increase in variance as model complexity grows: If increased complexity leads to a reduced training error and tends to overfit the model, shouldn't bias, rather than variance, increase with complete overfitting? Why would variance increase in a model that is 100% overfitted to the entire dataset? I assume bias should outweigh variance in such a scenario, given a fully overfitted model is trained on all features, introducing significant bias. What's the flaw in my reasoning?
=========================================="""
content_few_shot_1_assistant = """Great question! The important idea that we want to stress here is that our idea of variance is the variation in our predictions over all the possible models we could get from training on any possible set of training data.
So, if our model heavily overfits, this means that it will twist and turn itself to perfectly predict our training set. If we collected a different training set and trained the same model, it would churn out vastly different predictions, hence why our variance increases the more that we overfit.
On the flip side, bias describes how far off we are from predicting the true underlying relationship between our features and output variable averaged over all the possible models we could get from training on any possible set of training data. So if our model almost perfectly predicts our training data every time, and our training data is generated via $g(x) + \epsilon$ where $\mathbb{E}[\epsilon] = 0$, then our model bias $\mathbb{E}[\hat{Y}] - g(x)$ is going to be close to zero.
