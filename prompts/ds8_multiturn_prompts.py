Empty tables can be created using the `Table` function. An empty table is useful because it can be extended to contain new rows and columns.

The `with_columns` method on a table constructs a new table with additional labeled columns. Each column of a table is an array. To add one new column to a table, call `with_columns` with a label and an array. (The `with_column` method can be used with the same effect.)

Below, we begin each example with an empty table that has no columns.


To add two (or more) new columns, provide the label and array for each column. All columns must have the same length, or an error will occur.

Table().with_columns(
    'Number of petals', make_array(8, 34, 5),
    'Name', make_array('lotus', 'sunflower', 'rose')
)

| Number of petals | Name |
| --- | --- |

To examine the players’ salaries, it would be much more helpful if the data were ordered by salary.

To do this, we will first simplify the label of the column of salaries (just for convenience), and then sort by the new label `SALARY`.

This arranges all the rows of the table in _increasing_ order of salary, with the lowest salary appearing first. The output is a new table with the same columns as the original but with the rows rearranged.

nba = nba_salaries.relabeled("'15-'16 SALARY", 'SALARY')
nba.sort('SALARY')

Suppose we are trying to estimate a population parameter. Whenever we take a random sample and calculate
a statistic to estimate the parameter, we know that the statistic could have come out differently if the sample
had come out differently by random chance. We want to understand the variability of the statistic in order to
better estimate the parameter. However, we don’t have the resources to collect multiple random samples. In
order to solve this problem, we use a technique called bootstrapping.
==========================================
Worksheet solutions
==========================================
a. When we conduct a bootstrap resample, what size resample should we draw from our sample? Why?
The resample should have the same sample size as our sample. This is because our original estimate of some
parameter from our sample is based on a certain sample size. If we changed the sample size, the distribution
of the estimate would change.
b. Why do we need to resample from our sample with replacement?
If we don’t sample with replacement, then we will get the same exact sample every time.
c. When we conduct a bootstrap resample, what is the underlying assumption/reasoning for resampling from
our sample? Why does it work?
The underlying assumption is that our sample looks similar to our population — that is, the sample is
representative of what the population looks like. The validity of the bootstrap is based on this assumption,
because if the sample is unrepresentative of the population, we don’t actually end up with a good picture of
what range of values our estimate could take on.

When bootstrapping, the .sample() with replacement lets you simulate the variability of your data (and its estimate) without literally having to sample data again and again from the population. No assumptions are made about how the data is distributed in the population.
For A/B Testing, the null hypothesis is typically a statement about two sets of data (e.g. birth weights of babies with smoking vs non-smoking mothers) being distributed the same, and the .sample() without replacement is used to simulate data from the assumptions of the null hypothesis.
In both scenarios, we actually resample from our sample data for the purposes of understanding variability. Neither scenario involves going out to the population and getting new data. Bootstrapping aims to understand the variability of an estimate (such as sample average) so that we can make a confidence interval about a population parameter (such as the population average); A/B testing aims to understand the variability of a test statistic (such as difference of means) so that we can determine how strange our observed test statistic is relative to what could happen if the null is true."""
