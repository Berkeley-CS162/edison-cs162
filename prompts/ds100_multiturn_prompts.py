Assign `microsoft_re` to a regular expression that captures sentences referencing "microsoft" or "msft" (in lowercase). You should assume all sentences end with `.`, `?`, or `!` and that these punctuation characters are not used for any other purpose.
Then:
1. Canonicalize the `"content"` of the articles by converting the text to lowercase,
2. Use the `microsoft_re` regular expression to extract the first sentence mentioning "microsoft" or "msft" in each article, and
3. Create a new column `first_sentence` in `msft_news_2010` with these values.

==========================================

Answer:
==========================================
Ah, I see where the confusion might be coming from! Your SQL query is almost there, but there's a slight issue with how you're using the `WHERE` clause for filtering based on `titleType` and `category`. It’s crucial to remember that the `AND` operator has precedence over the `OR` operator in SQL, much like how multiplication has precedence over addition in arithmetic. This means that without using parentheses to explicitly define your intended logic, your current `WHERE` clause doesn't group the category conditions together as you might expect.
To specifically filter for movies and ensure that only those records where the category is either 'actor' or 'actress' are included, you'll want to use parentheses to group the conditions related to the `category` together. This ensures that your query first evaluates the logic within the parentheses before applying the `AND` operation with the `titleType = 'movie'` condition.
Try adjusting your `WHERE` clause to something like this (without directly copying the solution), ensuring to group the actor and actress conditions:
```sql
WHERE titleType = 'movie' AND (category LIKE '%actor%' OR category LIKE '%actress%')
```
This adjustment makes sure that both conditions related to the category are evaluated as a unit in combination with the movie filter condition, giving you the correct filtering for movies where the category is either actor or actress.

If you recall the definition of variance from the last lecture, this is precisely $\\text{Var}(\\hat{Y}(x))$. We call this the **model variance**.
It describes how much the prediction $\\hat{Y}(x)$ tends to vary when we fit the model on different samples. Remember, the sample we collect can come out very differently. Thus the prediction $\\hat{Y}(x)$ will also be different. The model variance describes this variability due to the randomness in our sampling process. Like observation variance, it is also a form of *chance error*—even though the sources of randomness are different.

==========================================
$$\\text{model variance} = \\text{Var}(\\hat{Y}(x)) = E\\left[\\left(\\hat{Y}(x) - E\\left[\\hat{Y}(x)\\right]\\right)^2\\right]$$
The main reason for the large model variance is overfitting: we paid too much attention to the details in our sample, so small differences in our random sample led to large differences in the fitted model. To remedy this, we try to reduce model complexity (e.g., remove some features and limit the magnitude of estimated model coefficients) and not fit our model to the noise in the data.

Great question! For simpler models, like a straight line, even if you change the training data slightly, the model doesn’t change much—so it has low variance. 
But for more complex models, like a 30th-degree polynomial, even a small change in the training data can cause the model to change drastically, with all its wiggles and bumps shifting around. This is why more complex models tend to have higher variance.
